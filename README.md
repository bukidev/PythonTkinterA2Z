# Python Programming for Blue Collar Workers : From Basics to Advanced with Practical Projects using Tkinter #

This book is designed for full-time blue-collar workers who have no prior experience in programming but want to learn Python programming from scratch. The book is written in a simple language and covers all the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including data types, control structures, functions, modules, file handling, and object-oriented programming. The book also includes a chapter on Tkinter, a popular Python GUI toolkit, and explains how to create interactive graphical user interfaces using Tkinter.

The book includes a series of practical projects that enable readers to apply the concepts they learn to real-world scenarios. These projects range from simple tasks like writing a program to calculate the area of a rectangle to more complex tasks like building a GUI application to manage a stock portfolio.

The book is designed to be used by readers who have only one hour a day to devote to learning Python programming. Each chapter is short and to the point, and includes practice exercises and review questions to help readers reinforce their learning. By the end of the book, readers will have a solid understanding of Python programming and be able to develop their own Python applications.
